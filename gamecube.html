What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Custom Robo</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/939A55E3-662C-4FB0-9388-3E22A84DABF5-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Nintendo</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Custom Robo for Gamecube</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Def Jam Vendetta</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B32F17BD-7BE5-4E5D-A8E4-E62FF55B0A4B-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Electronic Arts</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Def Jam VENDETTA invites you to the underground circuit of hardcore brawling.

Not all the locations feature bright lights and big cities. You will also travel to the lush forest of Green Plant watery vistas of Big Blue and barren wasteland of Sand Ocean. Each is filled with unpredictable twists and turns that will take plenty of steering skill to master. Gawkers beware.

You can attack other racers to force them out of the race.

Fortunately pit areas throughout each track will replenish your vehicles energy. * Grand GX Modes New to the F-Zero series a Story Mode brings this fast-paced world to life like never before.

Accurate impact from collisions, especially hard fouls and authoritative dunks; shot blocking with emphasis on precise hand-to-ball contact; and the ability to lunge for the loose ball, even if it means ending up on some celebritys lap.

Little, if anything, is overlooked: players move and react much like their real-life counterparts—goalies are especially acrobatic; the puck seamlessly glides, flips, and bounces around the rink and off the posts and goalie’s pads; players can be pinned to the boards during a scramble for the puck; missed shots are covered up by a diving goalie or slapped in off ensuing rebounds; arenas are painstakingly re-created and feature music and sounds specific to each. Off the ice, there’s plenty of strategy and options to tinker with. NHL 2K3 boasts over 30 sliders to alter effects ranging from ice friction to referee collisions.
