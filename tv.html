Like a visual companion to The Jerky Boys, CRANK YANKERS finds Kimmel, Carolla, and several of their comedian friends—among them Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Tracy Morgan, and David Cross—making real prank phone calls to unsuspecting individuals and businesses while puppets act out the scenario on screen. With ample doses of outrageous improvisation and a cast of recurring characters that includes the lascivious Spoonie Luv, confused senior citizen Elmer Higgins, cantankerous war veteran Dick Birchum, and, of course, mentally challenged teen Special Ed, CRANK YANKERS parlays the bastions of bad taste into oddly compelling hilarity.

The series follows Ash, the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead. When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons –personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its “Evil” grip. The cast is led by Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, Lucy Lawless as Ruby a mysterious figure who believes Ash is the cause of the Evil outbreaks, Ray Santiago as Pablo Simon Bolivar, an idealistic immigrant who becomes Ash’s loyal sidekick, Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly Maxwell, a moody wild child trying to outrun her past and Jill Marie Jones as Amanda Fisher, a disgraced Michigan State Trooper set to find our anti-hero Ash and prove his responsibility in the grisly murder of her partner. The series is executive produced by Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, the original filmmakers of the franchise, and Craig DiGregorio (“Chuck”), who serves as executive producer and showrunner.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Ash vs Evil Dead: Season 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/76114FFF-C27C-40BF-A87A-D980C8CA6B3B-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Ash vs Evil Dead: The Complete Third Season</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/0B30C474-2B4D-43AC-9EA3-93FDB857260C-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Ash is baaaack!

(His dad, strangely enough, was played by Chris's real-life father, Bob Elliott, a respected comedian in his own right.)<br><br>The two episodes on Volume 1 exemplify what Get a Life was all about: a straight-faced spoof of sitcom conventions that managed to avoid all of the conventions that spoofs usually observe. That it wasn't laugh-out-loud funny is beside the point; Elliott's fans know that his brand of humor is often diametrically opposed to conventional humor.<br><br>Though the plots are fairly conventional—in "The Prettiest Week of My Life," Peterson enrolls in the Handsome Boy Modeling School, where he competes with another student, Sapphire; "Bored Straight" finds Peterson trying to rehabilitate a gang of teens—the shows themselves are anything but. —Randy Silver</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">He-Man &amp; She-Ra: A Christmas Special</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1AB89E56-1D42-49EE-894A-83AB9A6439D3-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Bill Reed, Ernie Schmidt</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">The holiday season comes to the magical worlds of Eternia and Etheria in He-Man and She-Ra A Christmas Special!

Originally created to sell a line of action figures the syndicated series transcended its toy-tie-in roots with imaginative storytelling hand-drawn animation and an adroit blend of action fantasy and science-fiction.The series follows the mythical adventures of a mild-mannered royal whose magic sword transforms him into a loinclothed Prince Valiant-coiffed muscleman known as He-Man the most powerful being in the universe. Together with a loyal band of followers—including his pet tiger Cringer; his man-at-arms Duncan; the beautiful captain of the guards Teela; a cloaked floating magician Orko; and his winged mentor Sorceress—He-Man fights to protect the magically-powered Castle Greyskull from the evil clutches of his skull-faced nemesis Skeletor who presides over his own army of supervillains.

The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!—about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson—is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam. Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD—the Horton Hears a Who program, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track—but there is a new 15-minute featurette, "Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood." While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones' Private Snafu. (No mention of Jim Carrey, however.) —David Horiuchi</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">In Living Color: Season 1</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1B436A57-4D25-4A06-B993-237E485DD9F3-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Keenen Ivory Wayans, Matt Wickline, Paul Miller</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Two snaps up for In living Color on DVD!

The animation is superior to anything recently devoted to a superhero...or super-antihero, in this case. Al Simmons was a government assassin before he was burned to death and sent to hell (plot summary's starting out nicely, isn't it?). After making a particularly bad deal with the devil—to lead Satan's dark armies in exchange for seeing his wife again—Spawn is let loose upon the world. He immediately whacks three mob hit men, making his presence known and getting himself into all sorts of trouble. Spawn is also visited by the Clown, an obese, disgusting Beatrice, guiding our third-degree-burned Dante through this hellish, topside world. There are other nasty characters, but in this first segment a very gratuitous inclusion of a child murderer goes too far for even this mature fare. Spawn isn't fun; there's very little joy in any of this. But the point isn't fun—it's brutal, adult-comic style. And there's plenty of it. —Keith Simanton<br><br>Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2<br>From the mind of comic-book maestro Todd McFarlane comes the second season of episodes of the animated Spawn. Highly stylized animation and provocative story lines make Spawn a sophisticated cartoon sometimes more appropriate for older audiences. Murder victim Al Simmons has returned from hell to earth as a "hellspawn," a soldier for the army of darkness sent to collect more souls for hell. In these episodes, Spawn meets the man who assassinated him and becomes suspicious of the organization that ordered him killed. Jason Wynn, the leader of the group, plans to sell weapons of mass destruction stolen from the military. Spawn's former wife, Wanda, has since remarried Terry Fitzgerald, with whom Spawn must reconcile. Terry is hot on the trail of the missing arms, and Wynn and his assassins, including the highly trained Merrick, set out to kill Terry, Wanda, and their daughter, Cyan. Spawn foils the plot while realizing the hard truth that Wanda has a new life. —Shannon Gee<br><br>Spawn 3: The Ultimate Battle<br>The third chapter of this compelling HBO miniseries answers a number of questions—namely, who is the omnipotent old man who hides in the shadows and why is the mysterious Asian reporter (Jade) investigating the alley murders? Spawn has reached a crossroads, and he must choose between the forces of darkness and light. But it's not clear-cut: Al (Spawn) must deliberate over the seemingly minor differences that separate heaven and hell in his world. As a former assassin for the NSA, he "opened the eyes of hell" with his iniquitous deeds of depravity; therefore, his journey to hell was preordained. But this particular section of the series intriguingly asks, What if you had no choice, and killing was not just the only way out of a squeeze but was also your fate? Intellectual stuff, indeed. But as with the rest of the series, a profound metaphysical puzzle is brought to the fore without justifying it with an answer. It's frustrating, but also keeps you firmly planted in your chair, pondering conundrum after conundrum. —Jeremy Storey</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/80AF618C-9AD5-4C5F-BB63-8535A04B5E9A-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Brandon Vietti, Audu Paden, Sean Frewer, Vincent Edwards (III), Ezekiel Norton</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">When a nasty bite by an irradiated spider endows teenager Peter Parker with miraculous, arachnid-like powers, his death defying heroism wins him admiration from those in need.

Some of Hollywood's biggest names took part, either working in front or behind the camera. Hosting duties fell to everyone's favorite decaying corpse, the Cryptkeeper. The success of this series spawned a Saturday morning cartoon series (Tales From the Cryptkeeper), a short-lived Saturday morning game show on CBS (Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House) and lots of merchandise. Two feature films (Demon Knight and Bordello of Blood) were also produced and released in the late 90's. The TV series originally aired on HBO, but was later syndicated to Fox, the Sci-Fi Channel, and most recently AMC. Despite being a short season (only 6 episodes), Season 1 enjoyed the highest ratings in its HBO airings.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Tales From the Crypt: The Complete Second Season</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F5F636DA-7CBF-4E07-A5B3-D0658E880A6D-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlie Picerni, Chris Walas, David Burton Morris, Fred Dekker</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Two scary!

The stakes: all our tomorrows. A nascent AI, assisted by droids, continues to edge toward world domination and the ruin of humankind. It accepts no limits. It fears no one. Except John Connor. The machines know John, now 16, is the future head of the resistance. They know he is growing in abilities. They must find and terminate him. But Sarah Connor is there, protecting and instructing her son as he becomes the man he’s destined to be. The hunt is on in a season of powerful revelations, breathless pursuits and bravura effects.

Based on a line of robot toys from Takara—licensed to Hasbro in America—that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino's Gundam Mobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. Like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest. Unrated; suitable for age 6 and up: Robot vs. robot violence. —Charles Solomon</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Transformers: Season 2 Part 1</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E5C4B7BC-402D-4A4D-8751-92173F9F183E-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Al Kouzel, Andy Kim, Bob Kirk, Bob Matz, Bob Treat</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Earth is the battleground, control of the Universe is the prize, and the only defense is an army of Autobots able to transform into massive fighting machines as powerful as their enemy—the deadly Decepticons.

Each robot-character could be reconfigured to form a car, a tank, a plane, etc. The Transformers series (Tatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers or Fight Super Living Robots Transformers) was written in America, but animated in Japan. The 24 episodes in this collection, which ran between October 1985 and January 1986, conclude the second season and lead up to Transformers 2006. Each episode forms a self-contained story, with little in the way of larger character arcs or plot developments tying them together. Although the cast has expanded, the Autobots remain the good guys who defeat the bad guy Decepticons, and no one expects anything else. Although the character designs and animation are Japanese, the direction is pure American Saturday morning: instead of creating effective transitions, the filmmakers just cut to a shot of the logo—a standard practice in Hanna-Barbera kidvid. Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a brisk commerce in the original toys have kept Transformers alive in the hearts of its fans. But like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to nostalgic adults who watched the show as kids.

Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin, Academy Award®-winner for “The Piano”) works as a waitress at the rural bar Merlotte's. Though outwardly a typical young woman, she keeps a dangerous secret: she has the ability to hear the thoughts of others. Her situation is further complicated when the bar gets its first vampire patron - 173-year old Bill Compton (Steven Moyer, "Quills") - and the two outsiders are immediately drawn to each other. Delivering the best of what audiences have come to expect from Creator and Executive Producer Alan Ball (writer of Oscar®-winning Best Picture "American Beauty", creator of the Emmy® Award-winning HBO® series “Six Feet Under"), TRUE BLOOD is a dark and sexy tale that boldly delves into the heart - and the neck - of the Deep South.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">True Blood: Season 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/593159B8-EF8B-437E-8C3E-8E3BD1DF271E-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Adam Davidson, Daniel Minahan, John Dahl, Michael Cuesta, Michael Lehmann</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">When we last checked in with Sookie Stackhouse, the mystery surrounding a Bon Temps serial killer had finally been solved, to the town’sinfinite relief.

Rarely syndicated, the Twin Peaks television series has lost none of its quirky and queasy power to get under your skin and haunt your dreams. So brew up a pot of some "damn fine coffee," dig into some cherry pie, and lose yourself in David Lynch and Mark Frost's murder mystery and soap opera, which unfolds, in one character's words, "like a beautiful dream and terrible nightmare all at once." Twin Peaks was a pop culture phenomenon for one season at least, until the increasingly bizarre twists and maddening teases so confounded audiences that they lost interest in just who killed Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). This series was a career peak for most of its eclectic ensemble cast, including Kyle MacLachlan as straight-arrow FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, Michael Ontkean as local Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Sherilyn Fenn as bad girl Audrey Horne, Peggy Lipton as waitress Norma Jennings, and Catherine Coulson as the Log Lady. Alumni enjoying current success include Lara Flynn Boyle ("The Practice"), as good girl Donna Hayward, and Miguel Ferrer ("Crossing Jordan"), hilarious as forensics expert Albert Rosenfield (who has absolutely no "social niceties"). This four-disc set contains the first season's seven episodes, minus, curiously, the series pilot. Newcomers will be scratching their heads over the "Previously on Twin Peaks" prologue, but an accompanying booklet sums up the story. Special features include episode introductions by the Log Lady (originally broadcast on Bravo), commentaries by assorted episode directors (but not Lynch), and features from the archives of the fanzine Wrapped in Plastic. —Donald Liebenson</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D04362A2-180F-46E6-AA97-A5F3F7FB0A6C-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Sheryl Lee, Kyle MacLachlan.
