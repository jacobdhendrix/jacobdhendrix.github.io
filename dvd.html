Smith, Joel Goodman, James Cameron</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some "issues" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats in Aliens. —David Chute</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Akira</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B01C2CA2-855F-4534-90A8-620804BA385F-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Katsuhiro Ôtomo</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">In 1988, the landmark Anime film AKIRA, by director Katsuhiro Otomo, defined the cutting edge of Anime around the world.

Tetsuo, captured by the military, is subjected to experiments that make him a powerful psychic, but, unfortunately for Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo's powers rage out of control and he lashes out at the world that has oppressed him!

Eleven years later, he would unleash the most shocking motion picture experience for all times.

It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre cliché right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods—miles from civilization—find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. —Dave McCoy</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Army of Darkness</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/ECECF278-EA35-4E59-AF66-9025C477A1AA-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Bruce Campbell</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Bound in human flesh, inked in blood, and amazingly hard to pronounce, the ancient "Necronomicon," or "Book of the Dead," transports a department store clerk and his '73 Oldsmobile into England's Dark Ages to face legions of undead beasts in director Sam Raimi's (A Simple Plan) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic starring Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead).</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Family Guy: Volume 1: Seasons 1 &amp; 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/899877A2-D92C-4830-BEEB-B2DC542D5DCA-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Harold McKenzie, Karyn Finley Thompson</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Meet the Griffins: Peter, the big, lovable oaf who always says what’s on his mind.

It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two being Halloween's Michael Myers and A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the original Friday the 13th popularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clichés: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see a Friday the 13th movie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma's Carrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud—you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo—who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course. —Mark Englehart</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Friday the 13th Part 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/A87D1CAA-7AF0-4617-BFD3-9E7AF5DA2B3D-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Steve Miner</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Just when you thought it was safe to go back to camp . . . here's even more heart-pounding terror.<br><br>Five years after the horrible bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, all that remains is the legend of Jason Voorhees and his demented mother, who had murdered seven camp counselors.

That's the only possible explanation for Get a Life, Chris Elliott's short-lived series in which he starred as a thirtysomething paperboy, Chris Peterson, who still lived at home with his folks. (His dad, strangely enough, was played by Chris's real-life father, Bob Elliott, a respected comedian in his own right.)<br><br>The two episodes on Volume 1 exemplify what Get a Life was all about: a straight-faced spoof of sitcom conventions that managed to avoid all of the conventions that spoofs usually observe. That it wasn't laugh-out-loud funny is beside the point; Elliott's fans know that his brand of humor is often diametrically opposed to conventional humor.<br><br>Though the plots are fairly conventional—in "The Prettiest Week of My Life," Peterson enrolls in the Handsome Boy Modeling School, where he competes with another student, Sapphire; "Bored Straight" finds Peterson trying to rehabilitate a gang of teens—the shows themselves are anything but. —Randy Silver</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Ghost in the Shell</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/BA3D0E46-0F4F-4D42-AA42-0F657BD6CC33-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Mamoru Oshii</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">DVD.

True to the fashion of cautionary monster movies, Godzilla has arisen due to nuclear radiation—a 400-foot, fire-breathing dinosaur resurrected in Tokyo Bay—and proceeds to devastate Tokyo. Hardly a bogus building is left unbusted, nary a toy tank unmelted, by the reptilian rogue, until scientists discover another weapon of awesome destruction that just might stop him. The special effects are impressive, with the filming done so as to mask the fact that the monster is just a guy in a rubber suit, working better here than in the sequels, where they seem to have given up any pretense to that fact, in favor of flamboyant effects and battle sequences that more often than not are delightfully, unabashedly juvenile. The DVD includes a wonderful 25-minute documentary on movie monsters, pieced together from old trailers. This DVD offers your choice of Dolby 5.1 Surround or Mono, cropped-screen or letterboxed, and a plethora of other features. It is also available in a boxed set with four more of the best Godzilla flicks by director Inoshiro Honda. —Jim Gay</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla Raids Again</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/06305526-D0AA-4F41-B041-6119943B2107-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">(Action) Godzilla is back, and this time he’s not alone!

Radiation from nuclear testing revives Godzilla from the earth, who proceeds to threaten the egg and the cities, unless Mothra and his larvae hatched from the egg can stop him. The battle sequences between Mothra and Godzilla, and between Godzilla and the larvae, are spectacularly vivid and colorful.

Once discovered by our astronauts, including the ultra-hip Nick Adams (spouting such phrases as "That's right, baby!" with innocent conviction), the Planet X-ers propose that they transport Godzilla and Rodan from Earth to their planet to help rid them of the Ghidra menace.

And it almost works, but for the ingenuity... well, you get it.

Godzilla's Revenge is number 10 in the Godzilla series, directed by the first and best of the Godzilla directors, Inoshiro Honda. Essentially a childhood power fantasy, the film concerns Ishiro (the director's namesake), a youngster whose mind-tripping dreams on Monster Island help him gain the resolve to rout a gang of criminals and the neighborhood bullies who've been plaguing him. Part child's fantasy story, part monster movie with extended battle sequences, Godzilla's Revenge may be one of Honda's most consistently entertaining films, despite the fact that the colorful monster footage is reused from earlier movies. This is recommended fare for the juvenile or juvenile-at-heart. The DVD gives you a choice of cropped-frame or letterboxed in tantalizing Tohoscope, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or Mono, and some more extras.

This is the fifteenth film in the Godzilla series, and the eleventh by director Honda. Yet again the aliens (from the third planet of the black hole, whatever that means; they don't really provide directions) stage a takeover of Earth, this time with the aid of Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus (they're just what they sound like). They owe the mad scientist Mafuni for the use of Titanosaurus, who in turn owes the aliens for resurrecting his daughter, Katsura, badly hurt in an accident, albeit now as a cyborg with the ability to control their two mecha-monsters. It shapes up as the fight of the century when Godzilla is pressed into service for our side. The battling behemoths afford the most dramatic and vivid fight scenes in all of Godzilladom in this one.

Originally created to sell a line of action figures the syndicated series transcended its toy-tie-in roots with imaginative storytelling hand-drawn animation and an adroit blend of action fantasy and science-fiction.The series follows the mythical adventures of a mild-mannered royal whose magic sword transforms him into a loinclothed Prince Valiant-coiffed muscleman known as He-Man the most powerful being in the universe. Together with a loyal band of followers—including his pet tiger Cringer; his man-at-arms Duncan; the beautiful captain of the guards Teela; a cloaked floating magician Orko; and his winged mentor Sorceress—He-Man fights to protect the magically-powered Castle Greyskull from the evil clutches of his skull-faced nemesis Skeletor who presides over his own army of supervillains.

The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!—about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson—is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam. Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD—the Horton Hears a Who program, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track—but there is a new 15-minute featurette, "Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood." While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones' Private Snafu. (No mention of Jim Carrey, however.) —David Horiuchi</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/19E8F772-66A6-4599-97C5-2B58D1477842-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Ron Howard</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Inside A Snowflake Exists The Magical Land Of Whoville.

However, this very, very unauthorized—and unintentionally hilarious—biography (there's no footage of young Brian himself or his immediate musical circle other than a few seconds of blurry concert material) is also informative viewing for the merely curious. It mostly consists of rambling anecdotes from people who either were associated with him before he became famous or were ejected from his entourage, and it soon becomes clear that MM was and remains a genuinely talented visionary. If you're a fan, you'll have your faith confirmed. If you're not, you'll still end up feeling strangely pleased that both Manson and those he left behind are getting the respective levels of attention they deserve. —Roger Thomas</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Moby: Play</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/9B26564F-AA04-4170-B3D6-79C103C157AC-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Jonas Åkerlund, Moby, David LaChapelle, Fredrik Bond, Mike Mills</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">This, the perfect companion piece to the multi-platinum CD Play, highlights Moby as not just an artist and musician, but a personality.

The animation is superior to anything recently devoted to a superhero...or super-antihero, in this case. Al Simmons was a government assassin before he was burned to death and sent to hell (plot summary's starting out nicely, isn't it?). After making a particularly bad deal with the devil—to lead Satan's dark armies in exchange for seeing his wife again—Spawn is let loose upon the world. He immediately whacks three mob hit men, making his presence known and getting himself into all sorts of trouble. Spawn is also visited by the Clown, an obese, disgusting Beatrice, guiding our third-degree-burned Dante through this hellish, topside world. There are other nasty characters, but in this first segment a very gratuitous inclusion of a child murderer goes too far for even this mature fare. Spawn isn't fun; there's very little joy in any of this. But the point isn't fun—it's brutal, adult-comic style. And there's plenty of it. —Keith Simanton<br><br>Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2<br>From the mind of comic-book maestro Todd McFarlane comes the second season of episodes of the animated Spawn. Highly stylized animation and provocative story lines make Spawn a sophisticated cartoon sometimes more appropriate for older audiences. Murder victim Al Simmons has returned from hell to earth as a "hellspawn," a soldier for the army of darkness sent to collect more souls for hell. In these episodes, Spawn meets the man who assassinated him and becomes suspicious of the organization that ordered him killed. Jason Wynn, the leader of the group, plans to sell weapons of mass destruction stolen from the military. Spawn's former wife, Wanda, has since remarried Terry Fitzgerald, with whom Spawn must reconcile. Terry is hot on the trail of the missing arms, and Wynn and his assassins, including the highly trained Merrick, set out to kill Terry, Wanda, and their daughter, Cyan. Spawn foils the plot while realizing the hard truth that Wanda has a new life. —Shannon Gee<br><br>Spawn 3: The Ultimate Battle<br>The third chapter of this compelling HBO miniseries answers a number of questions—namely, who is the omnipotent old man who hides in the shadows and why is the mysterious Asian reporter (Jade) investigating the alley murders? Spawn has reached a crossroads, and he must choose between the forces of darkness and light. But it's not clear-cut: Al (Spawn) must deliberate over the seemingly minor differences that separate heaven and hell in his world. As a former assassin for the NSA, he "opened the eyes of hell" with his iniquitous deeds of depravity; therefore, his journey to hell was preordained. But this particular section of the series intriguingly asks, What if you had no choice, and killing was not just the only way out of a squeeze but was also your fate? Intellectual stuff, indeed. But as with the rest of the series, a profound metaphysical puzzle is brought to the fore without justifying it with an answer. It's frustrating, but also keeps you firmly planted in your chair, pondering conundrum after conundrum. —Jeremy Storey</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Species</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/940D1B23-5C45-4F46-AFA0-5A5925E7EC87-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Conrad Buff IV, Roger Donaldson</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">There's a kind of perverse marketing genius at work in this cheesy sci-fi hit from 1995 in which scientists create a half-human, half-alien woman named Sil (Natasha Henstridge) who's capable of morphing from a slimy, tentacled creature into a blond babe w</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Species II</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D3A94D6D-59D4-4FBC-9656-EA493D3B31C0-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Richard Nord, Peter Medak</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Having just returned from a mission to Mars, Commander Ross (Justin Lazard) isn't exactly himself.

Hayao Miyazaki's latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It's a "wonderfully welcoming work of art that's as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination.

Really though to be able to get two movies on DVD for about half the price of a tank of gas to me sounds like an okay deal. People really should lighten up and take into account the audience these TV movies were made for.\r\nOne bright spot in these movies are some quite ambitious special effects (for TV at least).</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Star Wars: Ewoks</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1CDA581E-2C86-4FB4-A22B-666E66FC07F4-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">star war adventure ...animated</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Steamboy</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/6A3D5B38-98FA-4F3C-9D45-CFDB6A6CF3ED-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Takeshi Seyama, Katsuhiro Ohtomo</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Victorian London is attacked by an army of futuristic, mechanized war machines, and only Ray Steam - the brave, young inventor who knows the astonishing secret behind the invasion force's incredible power - stands between the city's survival and ultimate destruction.

Tim Daly, the town sheriff and voice of reason and moral strength, locks up the quiet madman, but the deaths pile up as Linoge acts them out from his cell like a murderous mime pulling psychic strings. Stephen King, whose original teleplay is his best work for the screen since The Stand, transforms the sleepy burg into a Peyton Place of guilty secrets and criminal activity ripped from under a blanket of small town normality while the white-out of the snowstorm completely cuts them off from civilization. Director Craig R. Baxley nicely maintains an icy tension while the waiting game goes on, perhaps a little too long, before Linoge finally reveals "what he wants" and the drama turns into a struggle for man's soul in miniature. The more ambitious special effects and set pieces sometimes disappoint but are more than made up for in King's knack for turning the mundane into the macabre (the children's song "I'm a Little Teapot" has never sounded more sinister) and a few brilliantly realized sequences, the best of which occurs when townspeople are literally yanked out of existence while watching the storm. Storm of the Century is one of the most successful translations of King's brand of horror to the screen. —Sean Axmaker</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/088B3D49-D753-426A-9F38-7640B1A0C018-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Gisaburo Sugii</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">All the lightning-fisted thrills of the world’s wildest combat video game series explodes onto DVD in this brilliantly animated, sensationally supercharged adventure, Street FighterTM II: The Animated Movie.

Some of Hollywood's biggest names took part, either working in front or behind the camera. Hosting duties fell to everyone's favorite decaying corpse, the Cryptkeeper. The success of this series spawned a Saturday morning cartoon series (Tales From the Cryptkeeper), a short-lived Saturday morning game show on CBS (Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House) and lots of merchandise. Two feature films (Demon Knight and Bordello of Blood) were also produced and released in the late 90's. The TV series originally aired on HBO, but was later syndicated to Fox, the Sci-Fi Channel, and most recently AMC. Despite being a short season (only 6 episodes), Season 1 enjoyed the highest ratings in its HBO airings.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Tales from the Crypt: Season 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F5F636DA-7CBF-4E07-A5B3-D0658E880A6D-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlie Picerni, Chris Walas, David Burton Morris, Fred Dekker</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Two scary!

Based on a line of robot toys from Takara—licensed to Hasbro in America—that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino's Gundam Mobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. Like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest. Unrated; suitable for age 6 and up: Robot vs. robot violence. —Charles Solomon</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Transformers: Season 2 Part 1</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E5C4B7BC-402D-4A4D-8751-92173F9F183E-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Al Kouzel, Andy Kim, Bob Kirk, Bob Matz, Bob Treat</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Earth is the battleground, control of the Universe is the prize, and the only defense is an army of Autobots able to transform into massive fighting machines as powerful as their enemy—the deadly Decepticons.

Each robot-character could be reconfigured to form a car, a tank, a plane, etc. The Transformers series (Tatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers or Fight Super Living Robots Transformers) was written in America, but animated in Japan. The 24 episodes in this collection, which ran between October 1985 and January 1986, conclude the second season and lead up to Transformers 2006. Each episode forms a self-contained story, with little in the way of larger character arcs or plot developments tying them together. Although the cast has expanded, the Autobots remain the good guys who defeat the bad guy Decepticons, and no one expects anything else. Although the character designs and animation are Japanese, the direction is pure American Saturday morning: instead of creating effective transitions, the filmmakers just cut to a shot of the logo—a standard practice in Hanna-Barbera kidvid. Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a brisk commerce in the original toys have kept Transformers alive in the hearts of its fans. But like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to nostalgic adults who watched the show as kids.

Rarely syndicated, the Twin Peaks television series has lost none of its quirky and queasy power to get under your skin and haunt your dreams. So brew up a pot of some "damn fine coffee," dig into some cherry pie, and lose yourself in David Lynch and Mark Frost's murder mystery and soap opera, which unfolds, in one character's words, "like a beautiful dream and terrible nightmare all at once." Twin Peaks was a pop culture phenomenon for one season at least, until the increasingly bizarre twists and maddening teases so confounded audiences that they lost interest in just who killed Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). This series was a career peak for most of its eclectic ensemble cast, including Kyle MacLachlan as straight-arrow FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, Michael Ontkean as local Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Sherilyn Fenn as bad girl Audrey Horne, Peggy Lipton as waitress Norma Jennings, and Catherine Coulson as the Log Lady. Alumni enjoying current success include Lara Flynn Boyle ("The Practice"), as good girl Donna Hayward, and Miguel Ferrer ("Crossing Jordan"), hilarious as forensics expert Albert Rosenfield (who has absolutely no "social niceties"). This four-disc set contains the first season's seven episodes, minus, curiously, the series pilot. Newcomers will be scratching their heads over the "Previously on Twin Peaks" prologue, but an accompanying booklet sums up the story. Special features include episode introductions by the Log Lady (originally broadcast on Bravo), commentaries by assorted episode directors (but not Lynch), and features from the archives of the fanzine Wrapped in Plastic. —Donald Liebenson</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D04362A2-180F-46E6-AA97-A5F3F7FB0A6C-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Sheryl Lee, Kyle MacLachlan.
