Like a visual companion to The Jerky Boys, CRANK YANKERS finds Kimmel, Carolla, and several of their comedian friends—among them Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Tracy Morgan, and David Cross—making real prank phone calls to unsuspecting individuals and businesses while puppets act out the scenario on screen. With ample doses of outrageous improvisation and a cast of recurring characters that includes the lascivious Spoonie Luv, confused senior citizen Elmer Higgins, cantankerous war veteran Dick Birchum, and, of course, mentally challenged teen Special Ed, CRANK YANKERS parlays the bastions of bad taste into oddly compelling hilarity.

Originally created to sell a line of action figures the syndicated series transcended its toy-tie-in roots with imaginative storytelling hand-drawn animation and an adroit blend of action fantasy and science-fiction.The series follows the mythical adventures of a mild-mannered royal whose magic sword transforms him into a loinclothed Prince Valiant-coiffed muscleman known as He-Man the most powerful being in the universe. Together with a loyal band of followers—including his pet tiger Cringer; his man-at-arms Duncan; the beautiful captain of the guards Teela; a cloaked floating magician Orko; and his winged mentor Sorceress—He-Man fights to protect the magically-powered Castle Greyskull from the evil clutches of his skull-faced nemesis Skeletor who presides over his own army of supervillains.

The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!—about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson—is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam. Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD—the Horton Hears a Who program, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track—but there is a new 15-minute featurette, "Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood." While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones' Private Snafu. (No mention of Jim Carrey, however.) —David Horiuchi</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">How to Train Your Dragon</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/602AD57F-BDE9-4B57-825F-129CDBAEA4DA-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">How to Train Your Dragon</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">A winner with audiences and critics alike, DreamWorks Animation's How To Train Your Dragon rolls fire-breathing action, epic adventure and laughs into a captivating and original story.

The animation is superior to anything recently devoted to a superhero...or super-antihero, in this case. Al Simmons was a government assassin before he was burned to death and sent to hell (plot summary's starting out nicely, isn't it?). After making a particularly bad deal with the devil—to lead Satan's dark armies in exchange for seeing his wife again—Spawn is let loose upon the world. He immediately whacks three mob hit men, making his presence known and getting himself into all sorts of trouble. Spawn is also visited by the Clown, an obese, disgusting Beatrice, guiding our third-degree-burned Dante through this hellish, topside world. There are other nasty characters, but in this first segment a very gratuitous inclusion of a child murderer goes too far for even this mature fare. Spawn isn't fun; there's very little joy in any of this. But the point isn't fun—it's brutal, adult-comic style. And there's plenty of it. —Keith Simanton<br><br>Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2<br>From the mind of comic-book maestro Todd McFarlane comes the second season of episodes of the animated Spawn. Highly stylized animation and provocative story lines make Spawn a sophisticated cartoon sometimes more appropriate for older audiences. Murder victim Al Simmons has returned from hell to earth as a "hellspawn," a soldier for the army of darkness sent to collect more souls for hell. In these episodes, Spawn meets the man who assassinated him and becomes suspicious of the organization that ordered him killed. Jason Wynn, the leader of the group, plans to sell weapons of mass destruction stolen from the military. Spawn's former wife, Wanda, has since remarried Terry Fitzgerald, with whom Spawn must reconcile. Terry is hot on the trail of the missing arms, and Wynn and his assassins, including the highly trained Merrick, set out to kill Terry, Wanda, and their daughter, Cyan. Spawn foils the plot while realizing the hard truth that Wanda has a new life. —Shannon Gee<br><br>Spawn 3: The Ultimate Battle<br>The third chapter of this compelling HBO miniseries answers a number of questions—namely, who is the omnipotent old man who hides in the shadows and why is the mysterious Asian reporter (Jade) investigating the alley murders? Spawn has reached a crossroads, and he must choose between the forces of darkness and light. But it's not clear-cut: Al (Spawn) must deliberate over the seemingly minor differences that separate heaven and hell in his world. As a former assassin for the NSA, he "opened the eyes of hell" with his iniquitous deeds of depravity; therefore, his journey to hell was preordained. But this particular section of the series intriguingly asks, What if you had no choice, and killing was not just the only way out of a squeeze but was also your fate? Intellectual stuff, indeed. But as with the rest of the series, a profound metaphysical puzzle is brought to the fore without justifying it with an answer. It's frustrating, but also keeps you firmly planted in your chair, pondering conundrum after conundrum. —Jeremy Storey</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/80AF618C-9AD5-4C5F-BB63-8535A04B5E9A-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Brandon Vietti, Audu Paden, Sean Frewer, Vincent Edwards (III), Ezekiel Norton</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">When a nasty bite by an irradiated spider endows teenager Peter Parker with miraculous, arachnid-like powers, his death defying heroism wins him admiration from those in need.

Hayao Miyazaki's latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It's a "wonderfully welcoming work of art that's as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. "To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). It's a fantastic tale the whole family will want to experience over and over again.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/3954CC7E-58FB-4C07-A172-ACF16AF135E3-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">SpongeBob SquarePants, the world's favorite sea dwelling invertebrate, comes ashore to our world for his most super-heroic adventure yet.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Star Wars: Droids</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/AE177990-6378-4ECA-8010-4B1F80EC9C94-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Robin Lee, T.M.

Based on a line of robot toys from Takara—licensed to Hasbro in America—that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino's Gundam Mobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. Like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest.

Each robot-character could be reconfigured to form a car, a tank, a plane, etc. The Transformers series (Tatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers or Fight Super Living Robots Transformers) was written in America, but animated in Japan. The 24 episodes in this collection, which ran between October 1985 and January 1986, conclude the second season and lead up to Transformers 2006. Each episode forms a self-contained story, with little in the way of larger character arcs or plot developments tying them together. Although the cast has expanded, the Autobots remain the good guys who defeat the bad guy Decepticons, and no one expects anything else. Although the character designs and animation are Japanese, the direction is pure American Saturday morning: instead of creating effective transitions, the filmmakers just cut to a shot of the logo—a standard practice in Hanna-Barbera kidvid. Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a brisk commerce in the original toys have kept Transformers alive in the hearts of its fans. But like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to nostalgic adults who watched the show as kids.
