The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!—about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson—is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam. Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD—the Horton Hears a Who program, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track—but there is a new 15-minute featurette, "Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood." While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones' Private Snafu. (No mention of Jim Carrey, however.) —David Horiuchi</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">How The Grinch Stole Christmas</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/06D5B664-7F82-45C9-A7CD-D56A6A8EC8F1-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Ron Howard</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Discover the true meaning of the holiday season with the live action adaptation of the beloved classic, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas.

No one seems to know, until little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) takes matters into her own hands and turns both Whoville and the Grinch's world upside down, inside out... and funny side up. Filled with dazzling scenery, special effects, makeup and costumes, this is an adventure "that can make your heart grow three sizes – if you're not laughing too hard!"

When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max (Emjay Anthony) is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know, this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Living Fireplace: Volume 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/EAA66CFF-961C-4AA7-B7B8-5F41C0294E2F-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Stephen D.

First, sing along with "Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classic," a hilarious collection of carols—including Kyle and his family doing a particularly irreverent, a cappella version of "Dreidl Dreidl Dreidl," and there's nothing like Satan's "Christmastime in Hell"—surprising who you'll see down there. And Mr. Hankey definitely leaves his mark on his finale, too. The next episode is "Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson": Stan joins a trip to Cartman's grandma's house where the Cartmans are happily surprised that Uncle Howard is able to show up, having broken out of jail with his cellmate Charlie Manson.<br><br>The tape has a bonus third program: the "outrageous British documentary" Goin' Down to South Park, a half-serious, half-tongue-in-cheek look at the creators and production crew who animate South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, from their hot tub, discuss the origin of South Park and how the merchandising, money, and fame have made their lives so much easier. —Erik Macki</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">SpongeBob SquarePants: It's A SpongeBob Christmas!</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F04E450B-C40E-4770-8798-806133DEB9C0-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">It's Christmas and Bikini Bottom as you've never experienced them before!
