True to the fashion of cautionary monster movies, Godzilla has arisen due to nuclear radiation—a 400-foot, fire-breathing dinosaur resurrected in Tokyo Bay—and proceeds to devastate Tokyo. Hardly a bogus building is left unbusted, nary a toy tank unmelted, by the reptilian rogue, until scientists discover another weapon of awesome destruction that just might stop him. The special effects are impressive, with the filming done so as to mask the fact that the monster is just a guy in a rubber suit, working better here than in the sequels, where they seem to have given up any pretense to that fact, in favor of flamboyant effects and battle sequences that more often than not are delightfully, unabashedly juvenile. The DVD includes a wonderful 25-minute documentary on movie monsters, pieced together from old trailers. This DVD offers your choice of Dolby 5.1 Surround or Mono, cropped-screen or letterboxed, and a plethora of other features. It is also available in a boxed set with four more of the best Godzilla flicks by director Inoshiro Honda. —Jim Gay</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla Raids Again</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/06305526-D0AA-4F41-B041-6119943B2107-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">(Action) Godzilla is back, and this time he’s not alone!

Two tiny twin girls (sometimes singing like dual-diminutive Dorothy Lamours) from the island come to plead for the return of the egg by the greedy business guys who bought it for a tourist attraction, but to no avail. Radiation from nuclear testing revives Godzilla from the earth, who proceeds to threaten the egg and the cities, unless Mothra and his larvae hatched from the egg can stop him. The battle sequences between Mothra and Godzilla, and between Godzilla and the larvae, are spectacularly vivid and colorful. The DVD gives you a choice of cropped-frame or letterboxed in terrific Tohoscope, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or Mono, and some more extras. Oddly, the DVD contains no time code, so you never know how far into the movie you are at any given point.

The Planet&amp;nbspX-ers are forced to live underground because of the havoc wreaked on the surface by Ghidra, the three-headed monster. Once discovered by our astronauts, including the ultra-hip Nick Adams (spouting such phrases as "That's right, baby!" with innocent conviction), the Planet X-ers propose that they transport Godzilla and Rodan from Earth to their planet to help rid them of the Ghidra menace. Only, as it turns out, they have a dastardly plan to use the bipedal behemoth and his flighty friend to conquer the Earth, harnessing their destructive force with "magnetic waves." And it almost works, but for the ingenuity... well, you get it. There can be no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than watching monsters battle it out, while Nick Adams speaks in his accustomed English to others speaking dubbed English (really Japanese), like they all know what each other is saying.

Later, a feral boy with a certain physical deformity (a large head with a flat top) is captured by scientists who refer to the boy as Frankenstein. The creature grows to the height of 20 feet, escapes again, fights police and army, and is practically indestructible. Later, a reptilian monster goes on a rampage.

Long unavailable on video, Destroy All Monsters is the crowning achievement of the Japanese monster genre, with wall-to-wall action, cheesily magnificent special effects, and a final nine-to-one battle royale (against the awesome three-headed dragon known to fans as King Ghidorah) that's guaranteed to get even the most passive viewer noisily bopping around the room. A badly dubbed, logic-defying, supremely gonzo blast, presented in a widescreen format that allows the watcher to see every single rubber scale.

Godzilla's Revenge is number 10 in the Godzilla series, directed by the first and best of the Godzilla directors, Inoshiro Honda. Essentially a childhood power fantasy, the film concerns Ishiro (the director's namesake), a youngster whose mind-tripping dreams on Monster Island help him gain the resolve to rout a gang of criminals and the neighborhood bullies who've been plaguing him. Part child's fantasy story, part monster movie with extended battle sequences, Godzilla's Revenge may be one of Honda's most consistently entertaining films, despite the fact that the colorful monster footage is reused from earlier movies. This is recommended fare for the juvenile or juvenile-at-heart. The DVD gives you a choice of cropped-frame or letterboxed in tantalizing Tohoscope, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or Mono, and some more extras. It is also available in a boxed set with four of the other best Godzilla flicks by director Inoshiro Honda. —Jim Gay</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla vs Hedorah</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B7A62FB2-1137-49E4-9EF3-1A4D5CDD2831-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Yoshimitsu Banno</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">No Description Available.<br>Genre: Science Fiction<br>Rating: PG13<br>Release Date: 1-JAN-2007<br>Media Type: DVD</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla vs Gigan</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/CC8FA109-AF3E-42B9-8E62-F661AFB1D906-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Yoshio Tamura, Jun Fukuda</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">No Description Available.<br>Genre: Science Fiction<br>Rating: PG<br>Release Date: 1-JAN-2007<br>Media Type: DVD</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/91E90411-74F6-4E06-A9FA-FDC923834F21-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Jun Fukuda</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">No Description Available.<br>Genre: Science Fiction<br>Rating: PG<br>Release Date: 1-JAN-2007<br>Media Type: DVD</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Terror of Mechagodzilla</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D28360D2-C086-4C90-87B7-1B491E743B6A-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Yoshitami Kuroiwa, Ishirô Honda</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">In 1974, Inoshiro Honda, the original and best Godzilla director, returned after a five-year absence to direct this 20th-anniversary commemoration to Gojira (the original Japanese name for Godzilla, before the West Anglicized it). This is the fifteenth film in the Godzilla series, and the eleventh by director Honda. Yet again the aliens (from the third planet of the black hole, whatever that means; they don't really provide directions) stage a takeover of Earth, this time with the aid of Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus (they're just what they sound like). They owe the mad scientist Mafuni for the use of Titanosaurus, who in turn owes the aliens for resurrecting his daughter, Katsura, badly hurt in an accident, albeit now as a cyborg with the ability to control their two mecha-monsters. It shapes up as the fight of the century when Godzilla is pressed into service for our side. The battling behemoths afford the most dramatic and vivid fight scenes in all of Godzilladom in this one. Let's hope the aliens don't win; they're so smug. —Jim Gay</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla vs Biollante</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/EB2DA175-C6D4-44C4-889E-A27AFBA77149-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Kazuki Ohmori, Erik Estenberg, Ace Hannah</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">GODZILLA VS.

When a series of terrifying natural disasters begin to plague Japan, including the inexplicable offshore sinking of a U.S. submarine, a mystic old man warns his nation that Godzilla(r) has come back to destroy Japan as revenge for all the souls lost in the Pacific War. When mere military might can not squash the monster, the mystic man awakens the Holy Beasts of Yamato - King GhidorahTM, Mothra(r) and BaragonTM, sleeping giants that protected Japan in ancient times. These untamed mammoth beasts take on Godzilla(r) with frightening supernatural brute power that has been 2,000 years in the making.
