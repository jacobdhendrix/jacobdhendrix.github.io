If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly played Crazy Taxi in the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference between Crazy Taxi and the long-running TV series Taxi will immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega Dreamcast.<br><br>What's so hot about Crazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed, pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers—players drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any time, making for tons of replay value.<br><br>While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also includes an entirely new city. Crazy Taxi includes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.<br><br>Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers. —Jeff Young<br><br>Pros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sega GT</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/CBF20827-A69D-4C45-AD0F-15AD61F2AE58-140.png" width="140" height="123"></div><span class="creator">"Sega of America, Inc."</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">When we first popped in Sega GT, we were a bit skeptical. It doesn't just resemble the layout of Gran Turismo for the PlayStation; it's almost identical to it, from earning licenses to having your own garage and stocking it with brand-name cars. But the more we played, the more we fell in love with Sega GT's silky graphics that speed along with only the slightest blurring at night. The scenery is so distracting that most players will have to remember to keep their eyes on the road.<br><br>Usually, racing games can get pretty tiring, but Sega GT will hold most players, mainly because there are so many licenses you can earn from the auto manufacturers in the game, including Mazda, Suzuki, and other mostly Japanese auto makers. One of the coolest features here allows you to create a car from scratch and then see how it stacks up on the track—chances are your first design won't do well.<br><br>A little more reflection and other effects would have better integrated the cars with their surroundings, and some star-studded songs sure would have been preferable to the game's generic soundtrack. —Robb Guido Pros:<br><br>Much more absorbing than the average racing gameSlick graphics will make players droolCons:Generic soundtrack</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Shenmue</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/2E4A91FD-32C5-4CE5-B9ED-56D77C79DAC1-140.png" width="140" height="123"></div><span class="creator">"Sega of America, Inc."</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">To say that Shenmue is an anticipated title is an understatement; the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance were thrown in?<br><br>The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo Hazuki, whose father (a kung fu sensei, naturally) is killed before his very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this wrongful death.<br><br>Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space—in total, it represents maybe a square mile—but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines, and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are there.<br><br>Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges from Dragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m. each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallo</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Soccer Slam</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B52B68AB-AAF9-4206-95FF-A1E5BF1F0AAC-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">"Sega of America, Inc."</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Sega Soccer Slam may mention the beautiful sport in its title, but you’ll not find any competition here for the FIFAs or Pro Evolutions of this world. This is pure arcade soccer: loud, colorful, completely unrealistic, yet soooo much fun. Gameplay is simple: three-a-side fast footie action. You can head, dummy, slide tackle, shoot, pass, and conjure some quite unbelievable super-special shots using button combos and shot gauges. The pace is frenetic, with most games being tense 9-7 affairs. The soccer action plays really well.<br><br>The game is similar in style to Virtua Tennis in concept, though a lot less serious. Modes of play are standard: arcade, tournament, quest, etc. Play out the quest mode and the similarity to the aforementioned tennis title is clear. You select one of six preset teams based on continent and elemental power. Fire, water, toxic, spirit, electric, and ice form the special powers that each team can unleash on the pitch.<br><br>Teams are taken on in a round-robin style league with a special challenge offered to you after each match. The challenges are fun and in the style of Virtua Tennis—complete each one and you’ll be given cash to spend in the shop, where you can purchase kit upgrades, new grounds, game artwork, and more. Win the leagues and you'll be able to unlock extra hidden teams. Other game modes allow you to create a personalized super team and unlock more characters.<br><br>The game's graphics are excellent and each player is instantly recognizable with great animations and detail. The stadiums are well animated and the sound effects are vibrant. The game oozes Sega quality. All in all, Sega Soccer Slam is ideal for those less serious sessions and for pick-up-and-play gaming. —Laurent S.

What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Maximo Ghosts To Glory</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/4375FEA4-2C96-462A-80A5-5C623B9E9B8F-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Capcom</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Maximo: Ghosts to Glory follows its unlikely hero Maximo across several polygonal worlds as he teams up with the Grim Reaper to stop Achilles from raising the dead and taking over the kingdom.

The game is divided into missions, each mission having roughly the same goal: blow everything up and run to the end as fast as possible. Along the way, you fight hordes of mindless aliens, rescue hostages, and play with your choice of 18 powerful weapons. If you have an additional controller, a friend can join in the mayhem. The game saves your progress with the optional Visual Memory Unit and also makes use of the optional Jump Pack, which vibrates to indicate hits and explosions.

Imagine jump shots so real players actually adjust their movement in mid-air based on distance from the hoop and defensive pressure; a passing touch that gives you the control to skirt a defender or start a fast break; and dribble moves that let you jab left, rock right, crossover, spin and much more. Its all happening in NBA 2K3. No other game delivers the physical element of basketball like this. Accurate impact from collisions, especially hard fouls and authoritative dunks; shot blocking with emphasis on precise hand-to-ball contact; and the ability to lunge for the loose ball, even if it means ending up on some celebritys lap. With commentators that analyze strategy, cutscenes portraying lifelike player interaction, uniforms that move like real fabric, and a brand new ESPN broadcast system that wraps it all together, NBA 2K3 provides the complete NBA experience. * ESPN Broadcast Presentation — Replays, scores, music, and more are displayed in the famous ESPN style. * Expanded Passing Game — Control pass type and direction, fake a pass, and more. * Exciting Low Post Game — Fronting, faking, pivoting and facing up</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Linkin Park: Live in Texas</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/EA75E599-1343-440D-A581-B6D6B86738D9-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Kevin McCullough, Kimo Proudfoot</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Studio: Wea-des Moines Video Release Date: 11/18/2003</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1C7CD7B0-7836-46B2-828D-AE8659B38C2F-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Midway Entertainment</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Brand new and Sealed Nintendo Gamecube Game.

(His dad, strangely enough, was played by Chris's real-life father, Bob Elliott, a respected comedian in his own right.)<br><br>The two episodes on Volume 1 exemplify what Get a Life was all about: a straight-faced spoof of sitcom conventions that managed to avoid all of the conventions that spoofs usually observe. That it wasn't laugh-out-loud funny is beside the point; Elliott's fans know that his brand of humor is often diametrically opposed to conventional humor.<br><br>Though the plots are fairly conventional—in "The Prettiest Week of My Life," Peterson enrolls in the Handsome Boy Modeling School, where he competes with another student, Sapphire; "Bored Straight" finds Peterson trying to rehabilitate a gang of teens—the shows themselves are anything but. —Randy Silver</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">R: Racing Evolution</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/00FAAF48-17CD-46AC-BF64-F465228221EB-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Namco</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Namco's new racing title is a realistic racing simulation is the name of the game in R: Racing Evolutions, where players can customize fully licensed cars, and race in eleven fictional and real-life tracks.

The game captures all the intricacies of the NHL, from the furious, hard-hitting action on the ice to the day-to-day decisions made in the front office. Don’t like the production you’re getting out of one of your players? Send him down to the minors for a few weeks of seasoning to get his game in order. Prefer high-scoring shootouts or 1-0 grind-it-out defensive struggles? Tweak the game’s highly customizable AI to set things just the way you like them. Regardless of your preferences, NHL 2K3 delivers the goods to make this a more than passable hockey sim.<br><br>Like most of Sega’s recent sports releases, NHL 2K3 hangs its hat on stellar gameplay and sweet graphics. Little, if anything, is overlooked: players move and react much like their real-life counterparts—goalies are especially acrobatic; the puck seamlessly glides, flips, and bounces around the rink and off the posts and goalie’s pads; players can be pinned to the boards during a scramble for the puck; missed shots are covered up by a diving goalie or slapped in off ensuing rebounds; arenas are painstakingly re-created and feature music and sounds specific to each. Off the ice, there’s plenty of strategy and options to tinker with. NHL 2K3 boasts over 30 sliders to alter effects ranging from ice friction to referee collisions. And, of course, there’s the franchise mode that allows up to 250 years of dynasty building. —Larry White<br><br>(This review refers to the PlayStation2 version of this game)</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sonic Adventure 2 Battle</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/35EDBB19-5AC5-4B8E-A766-78FFFF271F64-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Sega Of America, Inc.</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Most Sonic the Hedgehog games are specifically for Sega related platforms but Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is an original game made for the Nintendo GameCube.

Realistic plays are perfectly matched with equally realistic graphics—a sharp contrast to the hyperactive arcade qualities of NFL Blitz 2000. Not only are the players more detailed and lifelike than in any other game we've played, but their smooth moves and impressive array of animations make it hard to remember you're actually playing a game and not watching one on TV. You can even see the breath of each individual player during cold-weather games.<br><br>NFL 2K also features a full-league fantasy draft, a tutorial mode, extensive game and season statistics, and excellent play and player creation options. Even its play-by-play and color commentary surpass other games on the market. All 31 NFL teams are included as are most of the real players, though each team does have a few generic guys with names like "Seahawks WR." Not surprisingly, some offseason transactions are not reflected in this game—namely, the Barry Sanders situation in Detroit. But he's in this game, so fire up NFL 2K and see Barry run again. Better yet, create a custom player designed to fit your style and sign him to your favorite team's roster.<br><br>NFL 2K does not make any special use of the optional Visual Memory Unit, apart from saving your game and roster data.
