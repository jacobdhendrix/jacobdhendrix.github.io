Stripped of his identity and deprived of all dignity, Northup is ultimately purchased by ruthless plantation owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) and must find the strength within to survive. Filled with powerful performances by an astonishing cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, 12 Years A Slave is both an unflinching account of slavery in American history and a celebration of the indomitable power of hope.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">24: Season One</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/493AA87E-B1A9-4045-B57B-441C70CB5A7D-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Twenty-four hours of a counter-terrorist agent's attempt to prevent the assassination of a presidential candidate.<br>Genre: Television<br>Rating: NR<br>Release Date: 17-SEP-2002<br>Media Type: DVD</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">24: Season Two</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/70EBD715-2EC0-435A-A8F1-DE84E195BC19-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">24: Season Three</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/11315884-8586-4843-818B-8C0D462A50AE-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Twenty-four hours of a counter-terrorist agent's attempt to prevent a drug dealer from using a bioweapon in the United States.<br>Genre: Television<br>Rating: NR<br>Release Date: 7-DEC-2004<br>Media Type: DVD</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">24: Season Four</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/6550BEC5-A5D2-4E2C-AB22-4E28C646CE8A-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Emmy nominated for Best Drama series, 24 Season 4 is considered by fans and critics to be the best season yet.

Smith, Joel Goodman, James Cameron</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some "issues" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats in Aliens. —David Chute</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Across the Universe</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/2A33328B-32C2-4DB4-8509-0F0EA5333E9F-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Julie Taymor</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Across the Universe, from director Julie Taymor, is a revolutionary rock musical that re-imagines America in the turbulent late-1960s, a time when battle lines were being drawn at home and abroad.

Jude falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a rich but sheltered American girl who joins the growing anti-war movement in New York's Greenwich Village. As the body count in Vietnam rises, political tensions at home spiral out of control and the star-crossed lovers find themselves in a psychedelic world gone mad.

Le Chiffre's cunning and cruelty come to bear on them both in a way Bond could never imagine, and he learns his most important lesson: Trust no one.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Cast Away</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E0F1F50A-DA47-4395-81B1-62E743877996-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Robert Zemeckis</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">DVD -Cast Away Tom Hanks Discover the unforgettable journey of hope, courage and survival</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Change-Up</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/FA3DE683-F1B2-4F44-9E48-8C2101CF61C9-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">David Dobkin</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman star in the outrageous comedy from the director of Wedding Crashers and the writers of The Hangover.

But what do they know? Here’s what this movie has going for it: gratuitous nudity, mindless violence, constant profanity, and a ridiculous storyline. Add to that stereotypes galore (gay, Asian, Latino, the neuropsychiatrically disabled, you name it), strippers with guns, a strike by porn actors (with a cameo appearance by Ron Jeremy), and a guy who refers to his heart as a "strawberry tart," and one can only wonder what’s not to like. In fact, writer-director-producers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor’s sequel to 2006’s Crank is an absolute hoot, a non-stop assault of crazy sights and sounds that will leave you breathless and laughing. As the action starts, Jason Statham’s Chev Chelios has not only survived the fall from a helicopter that ended the earlier film, but is now on the operating table, awake and watching as some Chinese villains harvest his "tart" in order to implant it in their aging leader (a wacky turn by David Carradine). Chev quickly dispatches the bad guys, but the fun’s just starting; the mechanical ticker they’ve put inside him needs constant recharging, so as Chev pursues the real organ, he must use whatever’s available (jumper cables, a police taser, a car cigarette lighter, high voltage power lines) to keep the fake one going. Storywise, that’s about it. But it’s plenty, as the filmmakers’ ultra-kinetic style—with its manic edits, cartoony subtitles, and other envelope-stretching effects—and amusing performances by Amy Smart (as Chev’s girlfriend), Dwight Yoakam (as a "doctor" who helps him figure out what’s happening), and others keep things going. No, Crank: High Voltage ain’t exactly Masterpiece Theater, but this is without a doubt one of 2009’s most entertaining films. —Sam Graham</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Crank Yankers: Season One</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/8DBF6F26-521B-4AED-9A56-DE1082E571CC-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Bill Berner, Bobcat Goldthwait, Hugh Martin, Kirk R.

In the wake of his parents' murder, disillusioned industrial heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) travels the world seeking the means to fight injustice and turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. He returns to Gotham and unveils his alter-ego: Batman, a masked crusader who uses his strength, intellect and an array of high tech deceptions to fight the sinister forces that threaten the city.<br><br>The Dark Knight:<br><br>The follow-up to Batman Begins, The Dark Knight reunites director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale, who reprises the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his continuing war on crime. With the help of Lt. Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham for good. The triumvirate proves effective, but soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as The Joker, who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante. Heath Ledger stars as archvillain The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart plays Dent. Maggie Gyllenhaal joins the cast as Rachel Dawes. Returning from Batman Begins are Gary Oldman as Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.<br><br>The Dark Knight Rises:<br><br>It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Dawn of the Dead</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B35DEC59-07B1-4292-B334-B4E8707AC159-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Dario Argento, George A.

It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre cliché right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods—miles from civilization—find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. —Dave McCoy</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Army of Darkness</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/ECECF278-EA35-4E59-AF66-9025C477A1AA-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Bruce Campbell</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Bound in human flesh, inked in blood, and amazingly hard to pronounce, the ancient "Necronomicon," or "Book of the Dead," transports a department store clerk and his '73 Oldsmobile into England's Dark Ages to face legions of undead beasts in director Sam Raimi's (A Simple Plan) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic starring Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead).</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Army of Darkness</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/7F114E9C-DFAB-4CF8-8B69-118EBB74A495-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Sam Raimi</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">All primitive screwheads, listen up!

The series follows Ash, the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead. When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons –personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its “Evil” grip. The cast is led by Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, Lucy Lawless as Ruby a mysterious figure who believes Ash is the cause of the Evil outbreaks, Ray Santiago as Pablo Simon Bolivar, an idealistic immigrant who becomes Ash’s loyal sidekick, Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly Maxwell, a moody wild child trying to outrun her past and Jill Marie Jones as Amanda Fisher, a disgraced Michigan State Trooper set to find our anti-hero Ash and prove his responsibility in the grisly murder of her partner. The series is executive produced by Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, the original filmmakers of the franchise, and Craig DiGregorio (“Chuck”), who serves as executive producer and showrunner.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Evil Dead</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/0D40AD56-9099-4736-96AD-9E216E973F4F-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Evil Dead (2013)</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">A secluded cabin.

A stand-alone sequel to the first two Final Destination thrillers, this one begins when a group of seven high-school graduates luckily escape from a deadly roller-coaster disaster, only to discover that their own deaths have been only temporarily avoided. Cute brunette Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) spots clues of impending doom in digital photos of her soon-to-be-expiring classmates, and an ill wind follows her everywhere, suggesting the presence of a supernatural force that makes her a catalyst for gory events, as each of her friends is dispatched in the order they were meant to die. Returning to give their brainchild a suspenseful, low-budget makeover, franchise creators and former X-Files writers James Wong and Glen Morgan cleverly play on our collective fears (the roller coaster sequence is genuinely terrifying) with a knowing nod to violent urban legends, which explains their inclusion of the '70s hit "Love Roller Coaster" on the soundtrack when two stuck-up girlfriends pay an ill-fated visit to a tanning parlor. And that's just for starters: With Wong as director, FD3 serves up its grisly deaths with tight pacing and humor, and the cathartic carnage is discreetly edited yet gory enough to satisfy hardcore horror buffs. When morbid mayhem is this much fun, it's a safe bet that another sequel is just around the corner. —Jeff Shannon</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Final Destination</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/A58249CB-3E78-4EB9-AFA7-8D3B6690151F-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">David R.

It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two being Halloween's Michael Myers and A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the original Friday the 13th popularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clichés: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see a Friday the 13th movie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma's Carrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud—you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo—who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course. —Mark Englehart</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Friday the 13th Part 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/A87D1CAA-7AF0-4617-BFD3-9E7AF5DA2B3D-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Steve Miner</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Just when you thought it was safe to go back to camp . . . here's even more heart-pounding terror.<br><br>Five years after the horrible bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, all that remains is the legend of Jason Voorhees and his demented mother, who had murdered seven camp counselors.

True to the fashion of cautionary monster movies, Godzilla has arisen due to nuclear radiation—a 400-foot, fire-breathing dinosaur resurrected in Tokyo Bay—and proceeds to devastate Tokyo. Hardly a bogus building is left unbusted, nary a toy tank unmelted, by the reptilian rogue, until scientists discover another weapon of awesome destruction that just might stop him. The special effects are impressive, with the filming done so as to mask the fact that the monster is just a guy in a rubber suit, working better here than in the sequels, where they seem to have given up any pretense to that fact, in favor of flamboyant effects and battle sequences that more often than not are delightfully, unabashedly juvenile. The DVD includes a wonderful 25-minute documentary on movie monsters, pieced together from old trailers. This DVD offers your choice of Dolby 5.1 Surround or Mono, cropped-screen or letterboxed, and a plethora of other features. It is also available in a boxed set with four more of the best Godzilla flicks by director Inoshiro Honda. —Jim Gay</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Godzilla Raids Again</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/06305526-D0AA-4F41-B041-6119943B2107-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">(Action) Godzilla is back, and this time he’s not alone!

Radiation from nuclear testing revives Godzilla from the earth, who proceeds to threaten the egg and the cities, unless Mothra and his larvae hatched from the egg can stop him.

Once discovered by our astronauts, including the ultra-hip Nick Adams (spouting such phrases as "That's right, baby!" with innocent conviction), the Planet X-ers propose that they transport Godzilla and Rodan from Earth to their planet to help rid them of the Ghidra menace.

Godzilla's Revenge is number 10 in the Godzilla series, directed by the first and best of the Godzilla directors, Inoshiro Honda. Essentially a childhood power fantasy, the film concerns Ishiro (the director's namesake), a youngster whose mind-tripping dreams on Monster Island help him gain the resolve to rout a gang of criminals and the neighborhood bullies who've been plaguing him. Part child's fantasy story, part monster movie with extended battle sequences, Godzilla's Revenge may be one of Honda's most consistently entertaining films, despite the fact that the colorful monster footage is reused from earlier movies. This is recommended fare for the juvenile or juvenile-at-heart. The DVD gives you a choice of cropped-frame or letterboxed in tantalizing Tohoscope, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or Mono, and some more extras.

This is the fifteenth film in the Godzilla series, and the eleventh by director Honda. Yet again the aliens (from the third planet of the black hole, whatever that means; they don't really provide directions) stage a takeover of Earth, this time with the aid of Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus (they're just what they sound like). They owe the mad scientist Mafuni for the use of Titanosaurus, who in turn owes the aliens for resurrecting his daughter, Katsura, badly hurt in an accident, albeit now as a cyborg with the ability to control their two mecha-monsters. It shapes up as the fight of the century when Godzilla is pressed into service for our side. The battling behemoths afford the most dramatic and vivid fight scenes in all of Godzilladom in this one.

Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1 Actors: Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis: Anyone familiar with the work of Bobby and Peter Farrelly, will be neither surprised nor shocked by the raunchy, gross-out gags that permeate Hall Pass. But what comes at the other end of the spectrum—namely, a tender, even sentimental point of view in which marriage is sanctified and even a couple of delusional doofuses end up on the right side of righteousness. Buddies Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) have attractive, loving wives (Maggie and Grace, played by Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate, respectively). After catching their husbands eyeing other women's butts, the ladies decide to offer them "hall passes"—an entire week during which they can pretend they're not married. Rick is a decent guy who refuses to buy beer for his underage babysitter and resists her flirtatious come-ons. Fred, on the other hand, expects to spend the week scoring young hotties with lines like "You must be from Ireland, 'cos when I look at you my penis is Dublin". But while Maggie and Grace find themselves courted by some studly minor-league baseball dudes, Rick and Fred mostly just strike out. The film has penis jokes (and a couple of real penises), masturbation jokes, scatological jokes, "I'm so stoned" marijuana jokes, and sexual terms (like "eye banging" and "fake chow") that can't be explained on a family website.

The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!—about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson—is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam. Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD—the Horton Hears a Who program, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track—but there is a new 15-minute featurette, "Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood." While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones' Private Snafu. (No mention of Jim Carrey, however.) —David Horiuchi</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/19E8F772-66A6-4599-97C5-2B58D1477842-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Ron Howard</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Inside A Snowflake Exists The Magical Land Of Whoville.

It mostly consists of rambling anecdotes from people who either were associated with him before he became famous or were ejected from his entourage, and it soon becomes clear that MM was and remains a genuinely talented visionary. If you're a fan, you'll have your faith confirmed.

At the story's heart is Caesar (Andy Serkis), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug. Raised like a child by the drug's creator (James Franco), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned. Seeking justice, Caesar assembles a simian army and escapes — putting man and primate on a collision course that could change the planet forever.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/6BC105FA-CEF9-4F9A-B1F4-4A281404EEA9-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">A war begins to brew between man and ape in this sequel to the 2011 hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's been ten years since the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity, and somewhere deep in the woods outside of San Francisco, Caesar (voice and performance capture by Andy Serkis) and his primate companions have established a thriving village built on the principles of peace and community. Shortly after welcoming a baby brother into the family, Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) is walking through the forest with his friend Ash (Doc Shaw) when they cross paths with a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo), who impulsively draws his gun and shoots Ash at the first sign of aggression. As it turns out, Carver is part of a human expedition led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who, along with the rest of his crew, races to Carver's side just as Caesar and the rest of the apes answer Blue Eyes' desperate call for help. An enraged Caesar drives the humans away after realizing they are no longer a threat, and decides to dispatch a small crew to follow them rather than yield to the pleas of his aggressive advisor Koba (Toby Kebbell) to launch an all-out attack. Instead, he decides to show the apes' strength by amassing outside of the humans' makeshift community at the base of an unfinished tower, making it unmistakably clear that the two species should remain apart. Meanwhile, the point of the human excursion was to get a dormant dam running again in order to power their community, which will soon be thrust into darkness should they fail to take action. Convinced that he could strike a truce with Caesar that would allow the humans to repair the dam, which is located on the apes' land, Malcolm gets permission from human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) to set out on his mission. Incredibly, thanks to the help of his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and a few other key allies, Malcolm succeeds.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Polar Express</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/44EC68D7-DE43-4139-A02A-5630A2D20713-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Chris Van Allsburg, Robert Zemeckis</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">All the enchantment, all the adventure, all the joy of The Polar Express – all in astonishing true Blu-ray 3D!

Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is a police detective who after discovering the aftermath of a particularly gruesome murder is convinced that Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is up to his ugly tricks again. Matthews's hunch turns out to be correct but the master criminal proves to be disconcertingly easy to capture. As it happens Jigsaw is eager to be put behind bars in order to throw the authorities off his trail as he once again punishes people who in his eyes have transgressed the boundaries of acceptable moral behavior. But instead of trapping two people in a filthy dungeon where they must engage in a terrible contest in order to win their freedom eight people have been locked away by Jigsaw and they must torture their bodies and minds to achieve the terrible justice Jigsaw seeks.

The animation is superior to anything recently devoted to a superhero...or super-antihero, in this case. Al Simmons was a government assassin before he was burned to death and sent to hell (plot summary's starting out nicely, isn't it?). After making a particularly bad deal with the devil—to lead Satan's dark armies in exchange for seeing his wife again—Spawn is let loose upon the world. He immediately whacks three mob hit men, making his presence known and getting himself into all sorts of trouble. Spawn is also visited by the Clown, an obese, disgusting Beatrice, guiding our third-degree-burned Dante through this hellish, topside world. There are other nasty characters, but in this first segment a very gratuitous inclusion of a child murderer goes too far for even this mature fare. Spawn isn't fun; there's very little joy in any of this. But the point isn't fun—it's brutal, adult-comic style. And there's plenty of it. —Keith Simanton<br><br>Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2<br>From the mind of comic-book maestro Todd McFarlane comes the second season of episodes of the animated Spawn. Highly stylized animation and provocative story lines make Spawn a sophisticated cartoon sometimes more appropriate for older audiences. Murder victim Al Simmons has returned from hell to earth as a "hellspawn," a soldier for the army of darkness sent to collect more souls for hell. In these episodes, Spawn meets the man who assassinated him and becomes suspicious of the organization that ordered him killed. Jason Wynn, the leader of the group, plans to sell weapons of mass destruction stolen from the military. Spawn's former wife, Wanda, has since remarried Terry Fitzgerald, with whom Spawn must reconcile. Terry is hot on the trail of the missing arms, and Wynn and his assassins, including the highly trained Merrick, set out to kill Terry, Wanda, and their daughter, Cyan. Spawn foils the plot while realizing the hard truth that Wanda has a new life. —Shannon Gee<br><br>Spawn 3: The Ultimate Battle<br>The third chapter of this compelling HBO miniseries answers a number of questions—namely, who is the omnipotent old man who hides in the shadows and why is the mysterious Asian reporter (Jade) investigating the alley murders? Spawn has reached a crossroads, and he must choose between the forces of darkness and light. But it's not clear-cut: Al (Spawn) must deliberate over the seemingly minor differences that separate heaven and hell in his world. As a former assassin for the NSA, he "opened the eyes of hell" with his iniquitous deeds of depravity; therefore, his journey to hell was preordained. But this particular section of the series intriguingly asks, What if you had no choice, and killing was not just the only way out of a squeeze but was also your fate? Intellectual stuff, indeed. But as with the rest of the series, a profound metaphysical puzzle is brought to the fore without justifying it with an answer. It's frustrating, but also keeps you firmly planted in your chair, pondering conundrum after conundrum. —Jeremy Storey</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Species</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/940D1B23-5C45-4F46-AFA0-5A5925E7EC87-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Conrad Buff IV, Roger Donaldson</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">There's a kind of perverse marketing genius at work in this cheesy sci-fi hit from 1995 in which scientists create a half-human, half-alien woman named Sil (Natasha Henstridge) who's capable of morphing from a slimy, tentacled creature into a blond babe w</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Species II</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D3A94D6D-59D4-4FBC-9656-EA493D3B31C0-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Richard Nord, Peter Medak</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Having just returned from a mission to Mars, Commander Ross (Justin Lazard) isn't exactly himself.

Hayao Miyazaki's latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It's a "wonderfully welcoming work of art that's as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. "To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). It's a fantastic tale the whole family will want to experience over and over again.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/3954CC7E-58FB-4C07-A172-ACF16AF135E3-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">SpongeBob SquarePants, the world's favorite sea dwelling invertebrate, comes ashore to our world for his most super-heroic adventure yet.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Stand</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/7773D989-362A-4629-A9BE-17C6E78CFDC9-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">After a government-spawned "superflu" wipes out more than 90 percent of the earth's population, the devastated survivors must decide whether to support or resist the advances of a mysterious stranger from way down South (heh-heh) who wishes to claim this new world order for himself. Although the six-hour length makes it nigh-impossible to digest in one sitting, this well-paced adaptation of Stephen King's apocalyptic magnum opus ranks among the best adaptations of the author's work, with strong performances from Gary Sinise, Miguel Ferrer, and especially Jamey Sheridan as a good-old-boy version of Old Scratch. The opening scene, set to the strains of Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper," is one of the most chilling things ever shot for television.

Wanting to be heroes in each other's and their hometown's eyes, they set out on an unforgettable two-day trek that turns into an odyssey of self-discovery. They sneak smokes, tell tall tales, cuss 'cause it's cool and band together when the going gets tough. When they encounter the town's knife-wielding hoods who are also after the body, the boys discover a strength they never knew they had. Stand By Me is a rare and special film about friendship and the indelible experiences of growing up.

Tim Daly, the town sheriff and voice of reason and moral strength, locks up the quiet madman, but the deaths pile up as Linoge acts them out from his cell like a murderous mime pulling psychic strings. Stephen King, whose original teleplay is his best work for the screen since The Stand, transforms the sleepy burg into a Peyton Place of guilty secrets and criminal activity ripped from under a blanket of small town normality while the white-out of the snowstorm completely cuts them off from civilization. Director Craig R. Baxley nicely maintains an icy tension while the waiting game goes on, perhaps a little too long, before Linoge finally reveals "what he wants" and the drama turns into a struggle for man's soul in miniature. The more ambitious special effects and set pieces sometimes disappoint but are more than made up for in King's knack for turning the mundane into the macabre (the children's song "I'm a Little Teapot" has never sounded more sinister) and a few brilliantly realized sequences, the best of which occurs when townspeople are literally yanked out of existence while watching the storm. Storm of the Century is one of the most successful translations of King's brand of horror to the screen. —Sean Axmaker</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/088B3D49-D753-426A-9F38-7640B1A0C018-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator">Gisaburo Sugii</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">All the lightning-fisted thrills of the world’s wildest combat video game series explodes onto DVD in this brilliantly animated, sensationally supercharged adventure, Street FighterTM II: The Animated Movie.

The success of this series spawned a Saturday morning cartoon series (Tales From the Cryptkeeper), a short-lived Saturday morning game show on CBS (Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House) and lots of merchandise. Two feature films (Demon Knight and Bordello of Blood) were also produced and released in the late 90's.

Now 25, Connor lives "off the grid" - no home, no credit cards, no cell phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way he can be traced by Skynet - the highly developed network of machines that once tried to kill him and wage war on humanity. Until, out of the shadows of the future steps the T-X (KRISTANNA LOKEN), Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine yet. Sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000, this machine is as relentless as her human guise is beautiful. Now Connor's only hope for survival is the Terminator (ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER), his mysterious former assassin. Together, they must triumph over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day - or face the apocalypse and the fall of civilization as we know it.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Terminator Salvation</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B3B6E696-7E4A-496A-A687-BF0E18557F69-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div><span class="creator">McG</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">In the aftermath of Judgment Day and the machine takeover, resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale) must counter Skynet’s plan to terminate mankind.

Based on a line of robot toys from Takara—licensed to Hasbro in America—that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino's Gundam Mobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. Like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest.

Each robot-character could be reconfigured to form a car, a tank, a plane, etc. The Transformers series (Tatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers or Fight Super Living Robots Transformers) was written in America, but animated in Japan. The 24 episodes in this collection, which ran between October 1985 and January 1986, conclude the second season and lead up to Transformers 2006. Each episode forms a self-contained story, with little in the way of larger character arcs or plot developments tying them together. Although the cast has expanded, the Autobots remain the good guys who defeat the bad guy Decepticons, and no one expects anything else. Although the character designs and animation are Japanese, the direction is pure American Saturday morning: instead of creating effective transitions, the filmmakers just cut to a shot of the logo—a standard practice in Hanna-Barbera kidvid. Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a brisk commerce in the original toys have kept Transformers alive in the hearts of its fans. But like Robotech, Transformers will appeal most strongly to nostalgic adults who watched the show as kids.

Rarely syndicated, the Twin Peaks television series has lost none of its quirky and queasy power to get under your skin and haunt your dreams. So brew up a pot of some "damn fine coffee," dig into some cherry pie, and lose yourself in David Lynch and Mark Frost's murder mystery and soap opera, which unfolds, in one character's words, "like a beautiful dream and terrible nightmare all at once." Twin Peaks was a pop culture phenomenon for one season at least, until the increasingly bizarre twists and maddening teases so confounded audiences that they lost interest in just who killed Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). This series was a career peak for most of its eclectic ensemble cast, including Kyle MacLachlan as straight-arrow FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, Michael Ontkean as local Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Sherilyn Fenn as bad girl Audrey Horne, Peggy Lipton as waitress Norma Jennings, and Catherine Coulson as the Log Lady. Alumni enjoying current success include Lara Flynn Boyle ("The Practice"), as good girl Donna Hayward, and Miguel Ferrer ("Crossing Jordan"), hilarious as forensics expert Albert Rosenfield (who has absolutely no "social niceties"). This four-disc set contains the first season's seven episodes, minus, curiously, the series pilot. Newcomers will be scratching their heads over the "Previously on Twin Peaks" prologue, but an accompanying booklet sums up the story. Special features include episode introductions by the Log Lady (originally broadcast on Bravo), commentaries by assorted episode directors (but not Lynch), and features from the archives of the fanzine Wrapped in Plastic. —Donald Liebenson</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D04362A2-180F-46E6-AA97-A5F3F7FB0A6C-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Sheryl Lee, Kyle MacLachlan.
