It is 1841, and Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor in a gripping performance), an accomplished, free citizen of New York, is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Stripped of his identity and deprived of all dignity, Northup is ultimately purchased by ruthless plantation owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) and must find the strength within to survive. Filled with powerful performances by an astonishing cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, 12 Years A Slave is both an unflinching account of slavery in American history and a celebration of the indomitable power of hope.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/CCC0565B-A9D3-471F-AD8A-039A34628DC5-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">28 Weeks Later</div><span class="creator">Juan Carlos Fresnadillo</span><span class="rating">3.5</span><span class="asin">B000VDDWEM</span><span class="description">28 WEEKS LATER is sequel to the successful 28 Days Later.<br><br>The film pick up six months after the Rage virus has spread throughout the city of London.

As the body count in Vietnam rises, political tensions at home spiral out of control and the star-crossed lovers find themselves in a psychedelic world gone mad.

But what do they know? Here’s what this movie has going for it: gratuitous nudity, mindless violence, constant profanity, and a ridiculous storyline. Add to that stereotypes galore (gay, Asian, Latino, the neuropsychiatrically disabled, you name it), strippers with guns, a strike by porn actors (with a cameo appearance by Ron Jeremy), and a guy who refers to his heart as a "strawberry tart," and one can only wonder what’s not to like. In fact, writer-director-producers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor’s sequel to 2006’s Crank is an absolute hoot, a non-stop assault of crazy sights and sounds that will leave you breathless and laughing. As the action starts, Jason Statham’s Chev Chelios has not only survived the fall from a helicopter that ended the earlier film, but is now on the operating table, awake and watching as some Chinese villains harvest his "tart" in order to implant it in their aging leader (a wacky turn by David Carradine). Chev quickly dispatches the bad guys, but the fun’s just starting; the mechanical ticker they’ve put inside him needs constant recharging, so as Chev pursues the real organ, he must use whatever’s available (jumper cables, a police taser, a car cigarette lighter, high voltage power lines) to keep the fake one going. Storywise, that’s about it. But it’s plenty, as the filmmakers’ ultra-kinetic style—with its manic edits, cartoony subtitles, and other envelope-stretching effects—and amusing performances by Amy Smart (as Chev’s girlfriend), Dwight Yoakam (as a "doctor" who helps him figure out what’s happening), and others keep things going. No, Crank: High Voltage ain’t exactly Masterpiece Theater, but this is without a doubt one of 2009’s most entertaining films. —Sam Graham</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5030986A-3A12-43F3-BFF4-5707D246A5EB-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Crazy, Stupid, Love.</div><span class="creator">Glenn Ficarra, John Requa</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B003Y5H57E</span><span class="description">Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling lead an all-star cast in Crazy, Stupid, Love.

In the wake of his parents' murder, disillusioned industrial heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) travels the world seeking the means to fight injustice and turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. He returns to Gotham and unveils his alter-ego: Batman, a masked crusader who uses his strength, intellect and an array of high tech deceptions to fight the sinister forces that threaten the city.<br><br>The Dark Knight:<br><br>The follow-up to Batman Begins, The Dark Knight reunites director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale, who reprises the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his continuing war on crime. With the help of Lt. Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham for good. The triumvirate proves effective, but soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as The Joker, who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante. Heath Ledger stars as archvillain The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart plays Dent. Maggie Gyllenhaal joins the cast as Rachel Dawes. Returning from Batman Begins are Gary Oldman as Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.<br><br>The Dark Knight Rises:<br><br>It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/1C4E9649-342A-48A4-8A09-6B7735605012-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Dawn of the Dead</div><span class="creator">Zack Snyder</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">B001CW7ZW6</span><span class="description">IN 1970S AMERICA, A DETECTIVE WORKS TO BRING DOWN THE DRUGEMPIRE OF FRANK LUCAS, A HEROIN KINGPIN FROM MANHATTAN, WHO ISSMUGGLING THE DRUG INTO THE COUNTRY FROM THE FAR EAST.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/CE0D2E99-5B83-4AA8-84F8-FA81FFD9F062-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Man of Steel</div><span class="creator">Zack Snyder</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00DYEN5QU</span><span class="description">A young boy learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth.

The series follows Ash, the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead. When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons –personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its “Evil” grip. The cast is led by Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, Lucy Lawless as Ruby a mysterious figure who believes Ash is the cause of the Evil outbreaks, Ray Santiago as Pablo Simon Bolivar, an idealistic immigrant who becomes Ash’s loyal sidekick, Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly Maxwell, a moody wild child trying to outrun her past and Jill Marie Jones as Amanda Fisher, a disgraced Michigan State Trooper set to find our anti-hero Ash and prove his responsibility in the grisly murder of her partner. The series is executive produced by Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, the original filmmakers of the franchise, and Craig DiGregorio (“Chuck”), who serves as executive producer and showrunner.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/C4123984-E031-4FA7-ADF8-7C7566CE2306-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Evil Dead</div><span class="creator">Evil Dead (2013)</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B008JFUO0Y</span><span class="description">A secluded cabin.

A stand-alone sequel to the first two Final Destination thrillers, this one begins when a group of seven high-school graduates luckily escape from a deadly roller-coaster disaster, only to discover that their own deaths have been only temporarily avoided. Cute brunette Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) spots clues of impending doom in digital photos of her soon-to-be-expiring classmates, and an ill wind follows her everywhere, suggesting the presence of a supernatural force that makes her a catalyst for gory events, as each of her friends is dispatched in the order they were meant to die. Returning to give their brainchild a suspenseful, low-budget makeover, franchise creators and former X-Files writers James Wong and Glen Morgan cleverly play on our collective fears (the roller coaster sequence is genuinely terrifying) with a knowing nod to violent urban legends, which explains their inclusion of the '70s hit "Love Roller Coaster" on the soundtrack when two stuck-up girlfriends pay an ill-fated visit to a tanning parlor. And that's just for starters: With Wong as director, FD3 serves up its grisly deaths with tight pacing and humor, and the cathartic carnage is discreetly edited yet gory enough to satisfy hardcore horror buffs. When morbid mayhem is this much fun, it's a safe bet that another sequel is just around the corner. —Jeff Shannon</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5119868F-A25A-4BA5-9ED1-8848E1737B5F-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Final Destination</div><span class="creator">David R.

Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1 Actors: Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis: Anyone familiar with the work of Bobby and Peter Farrelly, will be neither surprised nor shocked by the raunchy, gross-out gags that permeate Hall Pass. But what comes at the other end of the spectrum—namely, a tender, even sentimental point of view in which marriage is sanctified and even a couple of delusional doofuses end up on the right side of righteousness. Buddies Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) have attractive, loving wives (Maggie and Grace, played by Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate, respectively). After catching their husbands eyeing other women's butts, the ladies decide to offer them "hall passes"—an entire week during which they can pretend they're not married. Rick is a decent guy who refuses to buy beer for his underage babysitter and resists her flirtatious come-ons. Fred, on the other hand, expects to spend the week scoring young hotties with lines like "You must be from Ireland, 'cos when I look at you my penis is Dublin". But while Maggie and Grace find themselves courted by some studly minor-league baseball dudes, Rick and Fred mostly just strike out. The film has penis jokes (and a couple of real penises), masturbation jokes, scatological jokes, "I'm so stoned" marijuana jokes, and sexual terms (like "eye banging" and "fake chow") that can't be explained on a family website.

At the story's heart is Caesar (Andy Serkis), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug. Raised like a child by the drug's creator (James Franco), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned. Seeking justice, Caesar assembles a simian army and escapes — putting man and primate on a collision course that could change the planet forever.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5ED09790-39A7-42DD-A279-DB49E1A7FD72-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</div><span class="creator"></span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00QHOJ428</span><span class="description">A war begins to brew between man and ape in this sequel to the 2011 hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's been ten years since the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity, and somewhere deep in the woods outside of San Francisco, Caesar (voice and performance capture by Andy Serkis) and his primate companions have established a thriving village built on the principles of peace and community. Shortly after welcoming a baby brother into the family, Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) is walking through the forest with his friend Ash (Doc Shaw) when they cross paths with a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo), who impulsively draws his gun and shoots Ash at the first sign of aggression. As it turns out, Carver is part of a human expedition led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who, along with the rest of his crew, races to Carver's side just as Caesar and the rest of the apes answer Blue Eyes' desperate call for help. An enraged Caesar drives the humans away after realizing they are no longer a threat, and decides to dispatch a small crew to follow them rather than yield to the pleas of his aggressive advisor Koba (Toby Kebbell) to launch an all-out attack. Instead, he decides to show the apes' strength by amassing outside of the humans' makeshift community at the base of an unfinished tower, making it unmistakably clear that the two species should remain apart. Meanwhile, the point of the human excursion was to get a dormant dam running again in order to power their community, which will soon be thrust into darkness should they fail to take action. Convinced that he could strike a truce with Caesar that would allow the humans to repair the dam, which is located on the apes' land, Malcolm gets permission from human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) to set out on his mission. Incredibly, thanks to the help of his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and a few other key allies, Malcolm succeeds.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6BC105FA-CEF9-4F9A-B1F4-4A281404EEA9-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Polar Express</div><span class="creator">Chris Van Allsburg, Robert Zemeckis</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00447G29S</span><span class="description">All the enchantment, all the adventure, all the joy of The Polar Express – all in astonishing true Blu-ray 3D!

But instead of trapping two people in a filthy dungeon where they must engage in a terrible contest in order to win their freedom eight people have been locked away by Jigsaw and they must torture their bodies and minds to achieve the terrible justice Jigsaw seeks.
