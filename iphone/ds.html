In the Play Set mode, players pull pranks around campus with characters from Monsters University, go on swashbuckling adventures with the Pirates of the Caribbean, fight crime with The Incredibles, and tool around Radiator Springs with characters from Cars, with more post-release sets planned. Each of the sets offers a different kind of gameplay, including racing, sailing, open-world exploration, and classic action combat, and in addition to slots for two different figurines, the Infinity Base also has a third slot for circular or hexagonal Power Discs that let players give their characters special gadgets and power-ups. Characters from one play set cannot venture into the world of another play set, but Disney Infinity also includes the Toy Box mode, which lets all of the characters mingle together, and expands on a popular sandbox mode that debuted in the Toy Story 3 game. Toy Box lets players create their own game worlds from scratch using all the characters and content they have unlocked from each individual play set. Gamers can also use Power Discs to unlock special vehicles or themes from other Disney franchises like Tangled, The Lone Ranger, and Wreck-It Ralph. Much of the Toy Box mode is geared toward kart-racing action, but players are also encouraged to take a Minecraft-like approach to creation, destruction, and game-mode innovation. This starter pack includes the full game, the Infinity Base, three base play sets, the characters Sully, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Mr. Incredible, and one Power Disc.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/767EDD7B-4E58-40FD-86F7-F07E0F34C0BB-140.png" width="140" height="128"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</div><span class="creator">Nintendo</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00GANWVJE</span><span class="description">Two worlds collide in an all-new adventure set in the world of Super NES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
