It''s wintertime again, and the snow''s never looked this good! Ricky Winterborn and Akari Hayami have rounded up an all-new cast of characters to head back to the slopes for some high-speed competition. Race through realistic natural environments complete with powder drifts, ice patches and groomed hardpack...but don''t get comfortable. You''ll have to contend with massive avalanches, rockslides, cave-ins, bridge collapses and environments teeming with wildlife and other skiers. Not only that, but you must master a unique character balancing system and a catalogue of crazy tricks as you experience the speed rush of big mountain racing. Your slalom skills had better be tuned, because you''ll be going head-to-head with CPU-controlled masters or up to three human opponents.

Befriend your animal neighbors, decorate your house with cool furnishings, fill up your wardrobe, get to know the local wildlife, hop on a bus to visit the new city and just explore the world.

What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/20745A6E-4830-49D7-921D-7617B51E9423-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Castlevania: Curse of Darkness</div><span class="creator">Konami</span><span class="rating">3.5</span><span class="asin">B0009Z3K9O</span><span class="description">Castlevania: Curse of Darkness PS2</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/DEFCE5E9-129C-4470-A3BF-03197FA0D684-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</div><span class="creator">Konami</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">B0000A09EM</span><span class="description">MODEL- 20063 VENDOR- KONAMI FEATURES- Castlevania: Lament of Innocence The long-awaited next generation console debut of one of Konamis classic franchises Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is the series prequel that takes players back to the 11th Century.

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly played Crazy Taxi in the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference between Crazy Taxi and the long-running TV series Taxi will immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega Dreamcast.<br><br>What's so hot about Crazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed, pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers—players drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any time, making for tons of replay value.<br><br>While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also includes an entirely new city. Crazy Taxi includes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.<br><br>Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers. —Jeff Young<br><br>Pros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/F70D0920-11D0-41F2-8A7A-02DBF8A014F1-140.png" width="140" height="123"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Custom Robo</div><span class="creator">Nintendo</span><span class="rating">4.5</span><span class="asin">B0001JXAC0</span><span class="description">Custom Robo for Gamecube</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/939A55E3-662C-4FB0-9388-3E22A84DABF5-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Dead Island Definitive Collection</div><span class="creator">Deep Silver</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B01C7L07MA</span><span class="description">Welcome to the Zombie Apocalypse experience of a lifetime - and now more beautiful than ever.

The rest of us may want to look elsewhere. While the game boasts impressive graphics and really shows off the lighting and color abilities of the Dreamcast, repetitive single-player gameplay quickly leads to boredom.<br><br>You control an expendable clone soldier from a third-person perspective. The game is divided into missions, each mission having roughly the same goal: blow everything up and run to the end as fast as possible. Along the way, you fight hordes of mindless aliens, rescue hostages, and play with your choice of 18 powerful weapons. If you have an additional controller, a friend can join in the mayhem. The game saves your progress with the optional Visual Memory Unit and also makes use of the optional Jump Pack, which vibrates to indicate hits and explosions. While Expendable won't win any awards for creativity, depth, or longevity, sometimes you just want to team up with a buddy and kick alien butt. For those times, Expendable does just fine. —Michael Fehlauer<br><br>Pros:Brilliant graphicsChaotic, rampaging two-player cooperative playOver-the-top weaponsCons:Mindless "run and gun" gameplayRepetitive single-player game</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/2020A387-B9BD-4DC8-A745-2971BD6784CD-140.png" width="140" height="123"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Extreme G3</div><span class="creator">Acclaim Entertainment Inc.</span><span class="rating">4</span><span class="asin">B00005QDPT</span><span class="description">Throw on that helmet and get ready to break the sound barrier in the fastest-paced motorcycle game ever created.

Nintendo and SEGA — both accomplished masters of high-speed fun — have collaborated to create the fastest most visually stunning racing game ever. F-Zero GX is the race to end all races as fearless pilots risk everything to claim the title of the top speedster in the universe. * F is for Fantastic Prepare for sensory overload as you tear through spectacular turns and huge drops. In 20 wild courses you will be astounded as a constant stream of lights and futuristic architecture blur past at amazing speeds. The neon lights of Mute City have never looked so good. Not all the locations feature bright lights and big cities. You will also travel to the lush forest of Green Plant watery vistas of Big Blue and barren wasteland of Sand Ocean. Each is filled with unpredictable twists and turns that will take plenty of steering skill to master. Gawkers beware. If you get caught up in ogling the eye-candy you will find yourself in last place or even worse: scrap metal! Hitting walls and mines will deplete your energy. You can attack other racers to force them out of the race. You will have to carefully balance the twin needs of speed and survival as powerful boosters give you a temporary jolt of speed but will draw down your shields. Fortunately pit areas throughout each track will replenish your vehicles energy. * Grand GX Modes New to the F-Zero series a Story Mode brings this fast-paced world to life like never before. Gripping CG movies chronicle Captain Falcons relentless quest for the championship belt. Multiple objectives ratchet up the challenge — and fun.

Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known.

Three different sensitivity settings allow everyone from beginners to FPS veterans to find a response speed to their liking. In addition to the new control, the Nintendo GameCube games have new features and improvements such as 16x9 wide-screen presentation, and improved HUD system to accommodate the new pointer control, some graphic improvements, and newly added new difficulty levels.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/D0A768FB-117F-4055-98FF-455F73935187-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Metroid: Other M</div><span class="creator">Nintendo</span><span class="rating">3.5</span><span class="asin">B002BSC4ZS</span><span class="description">Metroid Franchise’s Heroine Gets Personal.

The Wii console finally makes that dream come true for everyone with New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Supporting 2-4 players in side-scrolling co-op and competitive platforming action, and featuring a mix of fan favorites and new characters, new powerups and various input options via the Wii Remote, it is destined to become an instant classic in one of the most beloved game franchises of all-time.<br><br>Co-op/competitive simultaneous multiplayer.<br>View larger.<br>Classic environments with a twist.<br>View larger.<br>Wacky new powerups<br>View larger. Gameplay<br>New Super Mario Bros. Wii, like all the previous releases in the Super Mario Bros. franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip down Mario Bros. memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote, New Super Mario Bros. Wii manages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.<br><br>A Franchise First: Simultaneous Multiplayer<br>Since the very first Super Mario Bros. game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. In New Super Mario Bros. Wii players can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced Super Mario Bros. fun.<br><br>Controller Choices Via the Wii Remote<br>In another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used with New Super Mario Bros. Wii is held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which is New Super Mario Bros. Wii.<br><br>Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wii offers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies – or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform – and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario’s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/97A6FEA8-66F2-4027-9041-073C79DA6ED8-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">New Super Mario Bros. 2</div><span class="creator">Nintendo</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B0088MVPFQ</span><span class="description">Nintendo New Super Mario Bros. 2 CTRPABEE PC Games</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/84F38C46-7536-4DE9-9D8E-49C6D49A4A7A-140.png" width="140" height="128"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">New Super Mario Bros.

Even its play-by-play and color commentary surpass other games on the market. All 31 NFL teams are included as are most of the real players, though each team does have a few generic guys with names like "Seahawks WR." Not surprisingly, some offseason transactions are not reflected in this game—namely, the Barry Sanders situation in Detroit. But he's in this game, so fire up NFL 2K and see Barry run again. Better yet, create a custom player designed to fit your style and sign him to your favorite team's roster.<br><br>NFL 2K does not make any special use of the optional Visual Memory Unit, apart from saving your game and roster data.

But they also undertake fantastical adventures by using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people. Their power comes from the Persona, the Jungian concept of the “self”. The game's heroes realize that society forces people to wear masks to protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by literally ripping off their protective masks and confronting their inner selves do the heroes awaken their inner power, and use it to strive to help those in need. Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match their perception and see through the masks modern-day society wears.</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/CEEC61DA-88F4-404D-AA40-EF9B54BAA945-140.png" width="110" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Pikmin</div><span class="creator">Nintendo</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00005Q8LY</span><span class="description">Pikmin is a little ant from space, looking to get back home as fast as possible.

It doesn't just resemble the layout of Gran Turismo for the PlayStation; it's almost identical to it, from earning licenses to having your own garage and stocking it with brand-name cars. But the more we played, the more we fell in love with Sega GT's silky graphics that speed along with only the slightest blurring at night. The scenery is so distracting that most players will have to remember to keep their eyes on the road.<br><br>Usually, racing games can get pretty tiring, but Sega GT will hold most players, mainly because there are so many licenses you can earn from the auto manufacturers in the game, including Mazda, Suzuki, and other mostly Japanese auto makers. One of the coolest features here allows you to create a car from scratch and then see how it stacks up on the track—chances are your first design won't do well.<br><br>A little more reflection and other effects would have better integrated the cars with their surroundings, and some star-studded songs sure would have been preferable to the game's generic soundtrack. —Robb Guido Pros:<br><br>Much more absorbing than the average racing gameSlick graphics will make players droolCons:Generic soundtrack</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/CBF20827-A69D-4C45-AD0F-15AD61F2AE58-140.png" width="140" height="123"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sega Sports NBA 2K3</div><span class="creator">Majesco Sales Inc.</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00006IKBF</span><span class="description">MODEL- 61015 VENDOR- Sega FEATURES- NBA 2K3 NBA 2K3 powers forward with the kind of improvement that only results from an off-season dedicated to perfection. Imagine jump shots so real players actually adjust their movement in mid-air based on distance from the hoop and defensive pressure; a passing touch that gives you the control to skirt a defender or start a fast break; and dribble moves that let you jab left, rock right, crossover, spin and much more. Its all happening in NBA 2K3. No other game delivers the physical element of basketball like this. Accurate impact from collisions, especially hard fouls and authoritative dunks; shot blocking with emphasis on precise hand-to-ball contact; and the ability to lunge for the loose ball, even if it means ending up on some celebritys lap. With commentators that analyze strategy, cutscenes portraying lifelike player interaction, uniforms that move like real fabric, and a brand new ESPN broadcast system that wraps it all together, NBA 2K3 provides the complete NBA experience. * ESPN Broadcast Presentation — Replays, scores, music, and more are displayed in the famous ESPN style. * Expanded Passing Game — Control pass type and direction, fake a pass, and more. * Exciting Low Post Game — Fronting, faking, pivoting and facing up</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/A6A0C27F-4904-4890-8C05-CBB32D49C66B-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Sega Sports NHL 2K3</div><span class="creator">Sega Of America, Inc.</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00006IKBI</span><span class="description">Realistic gameplay combined with total control over your team make Sega’s NHL 2K3 the game of choice for serious hockey fans. The game captures all the intricacies of the NHL, from the furious, hard-hitting action on the ice to the day-to-day decisions made in the front office. Don’t like the production you’re getting out of one of your players? Send him down to the minors for a few weeks of seasoning to get his game in order. Prefer high-scoring shootouts or 1-0 grind-it-out defensive struggles? Tweak the game’s highly customizable AI to set things just the way you like them. Regardless of your preferences, NHL 2K3 delivers the goods to make this a more than passable hockey sim.<br><br>Like most of Sega’s recent sports releases, NHL 2K3 hangs its hat on stellar gameplay and sweet graphics. Little, if anything, is overlooked: players move and react much like their real-life counterparts—goalies are especially acrobatic; the puck seamlessly glides, flips, and bounces around the rink and off the posts and goalie’s pads; players can be pinned to the boards during a scramble for the puck; missed shots are covered up by a diving goalie or slapped in off ensuing rebounds; arenas are painstakingly re-created and feature music and sounds specific to each. Off the ice, there’s plenty of strategy and options to tinker with. NHL 2K3 boasts over 30 sliders to alter effects ranging from ice friction to referee collisions. And, of course, there’s the franchise mode that allows up to 250 years of dynasty building. —Larry White<br><br>(This review refers to the PlayStation2 version of this game)</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/00000E4E-CC08-4EA6-B17E-2B5A01A069C0-140.png" width="99" height="140"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip</div><span class="creator">UBI Soft</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B001IM66ES</span><span class="description">Limited Edition version has many extra features.

It's a game in which the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance were thrown in?<br><br>The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo Hazuki, whose father (a kung fu sensei, naturally) is killed before his very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this wrongful death.<br><br>Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space—in total, it represents maybe a square mile—but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines, and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are there.<br><br>Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges from Dragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m. each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallo</span><div class="cover coverimage" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/2E4A91FD-32C5-4CE5-B9ED-56D77C79DAC1-140.png" width="140" height="123"></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Skies of Arcadia : Legends</div><span class="creator">"Sega of America, Inc."</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="asin">B00007KUUD</span><span class="description">You must gather your own crew of air pirates and journey through uncharted skies to vanquish the empire from every corner of the map.

This is pure arcade soccer: loud, colorful, completely unrealistic, yet soooo much fun. Gameplay is simple: three-a-side fast footie action. You can head, dummy, slide tackle, shoot, pass, and conjure some quite unbelievable super-special shots using button combos and shot gauges. The pace is frenetic, with most games being tense 9-7 affairs. The soccer action plays really well.<br><br>The game is similar in style to Virtua Tennis in concept, though a lot less serious. Modes of play are standard: arcade, tournament, quest, etc. Play out the quest mode and the similarity to the aforementioned tennis title is clear. You select one of six preset teams based on continent and elemental power. Fire, water, toxic, spirit, electric, and ice form the special powers that each team can unleash on the pitch.<br><br>Teams are taken on in a round-robin style league with a special challenge offered to you after each match. The challenges are fun and in the style of Virtua Tennis—complete each one and you’ll be given cash to spend in the shop, where you can purchase kit upgrades, new grounds, game artwork, and more. Win the leagues and you'll be able to unlock extra hidden teams. Other game modes allow you to create a personalized super team and unlock more characters.<br><br>The game's graphics are excellent and each player is instantly recognizable with great animations and detail. The stadiums are well animated and the sound effects are vibrant. The game oozes Sega quality.
